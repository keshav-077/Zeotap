# Zeotap Assignment

## eCommerce Transactions Dataset

### Overview
You are provided with an eCommerce Transactions dataset consisting of three files:
1. **Customers.csv**
2. **Products.csv**
3. **Transactions.csv**

Your task is to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), build predictive models, and derive actionable insights. This assignment will test your data analysis, machine learning, and business insight generation skills.

### Dataset Details

#### 1. Customers.csv
- **CustomerID**: Unique identifier for each customer.
- **CustomerName**: Name of the customer.
- **Region**: Continent where the customer resides.
- **SignupDate**: Date when the customer signed up.

#### 2. Products.csv
- **ProductID**: Unique identifier for each product.
- **ProductName**: Name of the product.
- **Category**: Product category.
- **Price**: Product price in USD.

#### 3. Transactions.csv
- **TransactionID**: Unique identifier for each transaction.
- **CustomerID**: ID of the customer who made the transaction.
- **ProductID**: ID of the product sold.
- **TransactionDate**: Date of the transaction.
- **Quantity**: Quantity of the product purchased.
- **TotalValue**: Total value of the transaction.
- **Price**: Price of the product sold.

## Assignment Tasks

### Task 1: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Business Insights
1. Perform EDA on the provided dataset.
2. Derive at least **5 business insights** from the EDA.
   - Write these insights in short point-wise sentences (maximum 100 words per insight).

#### Deliverables
- A **Jupyter Notebook** or **Python script** containing your EDA code.
- A **PDF report** with business insights (maximum 500 words).

---

### Task 2: Lookalike Model
Build a Lookalike Model that takes a user's information as input and recommends **3 similar customers** based on their profile and transaction history. The model should:
- Use both customer and product information.
- Assign a similarity score to each recommended customer.

#### Deliverables
- Provide the top 3 lookalikes with their similarity scores for the **first 20 customers** (CustomerID: C0001 - C0020) in Customers.csv.
- Form a **Lookalike.csv** with the following format:
  ```
  Map<cust_id, List<cust_id, score>>
  ```
- A **Jupyter Notebook** or **Python script** explaining your model development.

#### Evaluation Criteria
- Model accuracy and logic.
- Quality of recommendations and similarity scores.

---

### Task 3: Customer Segmentation / Clustering
Perform customer segmentation using clustering techniques. Use both profile information (from Customers.csv) and transaction information (from Transactions.csv).
- You can choose any clustering algorithm.
- Select any number of clusters between 2 and 10.
- Calculate clustering metrics, including the **DB Index**.
- Visualize your clusters using relevant plots.

#### Deliverables
- A report on your clustering results, including:
  - The number of clusters formed.
  - DB Index value.
  - Other relevant clustering metrics.
- A **Jupyter Notebook** or **Python script** containing your clustering code.

#### Evaluation Criteria
- Clustering logic and metrics.
- Visual representation of clusters.

## Submission Instructions

1. **GitHub Link**
   - Upload all the PDF and code files to a public GitHub repository.

2. **File Naming Convention**
   - Follow the naming convention for all your files:
     - `FirstName_LastName_EDA.pdf`
     - `FirstName_LastName_EDA.ipynb`
     - `FirstName_LastName_Lookalike.csv`
     - `FirstName_LastName_Lookalike.ipynb`
     - `FirstName_LastName_Clustering.pdf`
     - `FirstName_LastName_Clustering.ipynb`

## Evaluation Process
Submissions will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

| Task                       | Weightage |
|----------------------------|-----------|
| Exploratory Data Analysis  | 25%       |
| Business Insights          | 15%       |
| Lookalike Model            | 30%       |
| Customer Segmentation      | 30%       |

> **Note**: The evaluation process is automated. Ensure that your file formats and naming conventions are accurate to avoid disqualification.
